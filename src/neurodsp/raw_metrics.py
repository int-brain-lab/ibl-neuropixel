    Create a QC table with the following features for each channel for
    each snippets:

    - RMS of raw, butterworth, destriped, and residual (butterworth - destriped)
    for both bands (returned in uV).

    - DC offset of raw data for both bands (returned in uV).

    - Channel labels estimated from both AP and LF bands separately.

    - Channel detection features (LF and HF cross-correlation and HF PSD)
    estimated from both AP and LF bands separately.

    AP band data is filtered with a 300Hz high-pass butterworth for
    the BTR and DST features. LF band is filtered with a 2-200Hz band-pass
    butterworth. Snippets of 12x the length at the same starting times are
    taken from LF to account for different sampling rates.

    Returns a Pandas Multiindex dataframe with snippet and channel ids.
